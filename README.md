  <p align="center">
    This is a Spring Boot Starter library to send e-mails in the DigiWF environment.
    It can be used to send mails asynchronously through a spring cloud stream compatible event broker.<br>For attachments to not clutter the EventBus,
    paths to file locations on the S3-Filer are expected. The file is then grabbed by this library to avoid sending
    large files repeatedly through the EventBus.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The goal of this library is enabling async mail dispatching with a EventBus and a S3-Filer as your environment.

Features:

* Can be used to dispatch emails asynchronously through an eventbus.
* Can inform the receiver through an eventbus if the email has been sent or if there was a problem.
* Can get attachment files from an S3-Filer, no need to get them yourself and send it through the EventBus several
  times. Less clutter in your EventBus!
